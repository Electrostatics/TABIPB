# TABIPB
This TABIPB repo serves as a submodule to APBS, and also works as a standalone distribution.

##Build Instructions
To build as an independent executable:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This creates a tabipb executable located at tabipb/build/bin/tabipb. To run an example, navigate to the examples directory, and run ../build/bin/tabipb.
